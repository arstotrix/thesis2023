I'm a sucker for canon divergence, both reading and creating, especially when the train actually goes off the rails; it can be easy to get into the habit of 'this is how X event would have looked with the changes I introduced earlier' even when those changes really mean that X event shouldn't have happened at all, and the story ends up being a rehash of canon with a couple of extra flairs rather than an exploration of the core idea. Self-insertion can make that very easy, along with Peggy Sues. In the same vein, introducing a character or group from one setting into another almost always creates an outside-context problem with potentially fascinating results, and many abilities can do the same when transplanted into a new or existing character.

That being said, it was a bit of a surprise to be placed in Gryffindor rather than Hufflepuff(or so he’s been told). He’d pondered about it consistently throughout his first week at Hogwarts when he even had the spare time to wonder about such things in the worries of an oncoming war.Still, at the end of his third week, the question still remained. Why was Henry DeWitt placed in Gryffindor with his clever jokes, hard-working nature, care-taking attitude, and welcoming atmosphere that would be better suited for Hufflepuff?Or, 5 times MC Henry DeWitt shows the dysfunctional people of Hogwarts how to be taken care of, and the 1 time he really should've taken care of himself to avoid the same treatment.
