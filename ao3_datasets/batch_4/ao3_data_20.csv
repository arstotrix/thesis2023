This is my own take on the tri-wizard tournament. A lot of things are going to be different in this story. First off the tournament is going to be called the tri-task tournament or something that allows more than three competitors. The schools participating haven't changed, but Durmstrang and Beauxbatons Academy now accept both sexes. The plan is to use two champions from each school. The story will focus around the male Beauxbatons champion, who recently enrolled. This idea is taken from Deprived, however Fleur Delacour has no connection to him until he arrives at Beuxbatons. Mysterious and enigmatic, he does end up sweeping one of the champions off their feet. Since this tournament takes place later than in the book, certain students are allowed entry that wouldn't be in the book (age limit). This includes a very unexpected Hogwarts champion.

But James was getting lost in red hair and green eyes more often than he was in exploding chocolate frogs and ink that dried as swear words. The dynamic was changing, and nobody wanted to say anything about it. Nobody wanted to say anything about it because it was new and weird and wasn't supposed to be that way. Surely they'd all had dates and crushes and the casual meeting in a broom-closet while skipping out of Potions (most especially Sirius had these), but there were no serious relationships among Marauders. They were a band of boys with a very large hand-painted banner that explicitly stated 'No Girls Allowed', and now James wasn't holding up his corner anymore. ---This is part one of a two-part entry regarding Sirius' betrayal of Remus.
